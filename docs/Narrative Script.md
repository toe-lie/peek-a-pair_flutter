### **CHAPTER 1: THE FADING VILLAGE**

**SCENE 1**

*SETTING: OLLIE's small, cozy home in Baan Sook Jai village. His GRANDMOTHER is sitting in a rocking chair, looking sadly out the window at the great Banyan tree. The tree's leaves look pale.*

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT:** In Baan Sook Jai, the Tree of Memories held everyone's stories. But now, its magic is fading...

*(OLLIE comes over and puts a comforting wing on his Grandmother's shoulder.)*

**OLLIE:**
What's wrong, Grandma?

**GRANDMOTHER:**
Oh, Ollie... I was trying to remember the lullaby. The one about the little star. I've sung it a thousand times, but now... the words are gone. Like mist.

*(She looks at the pale Banyan tree. OLLIE looks too, his expression determined.)*

**OLLIE:**
I will find a way to help, Grandma. I promise.

---
**SCENE 2**

*SETTING: OLLIE's dusty family storeroom. He finds an old, wooden chest.*

*(OLLIE blows dust off the chest and opens it. Inside, he finds an old, rolled-up journal.)*

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT (showing the journal page):**
> _"My Journal. For the future Guardian._
> _If the Tree of Memories grows weak, its light must be restored. Its magic comes from the Great Naga of the Emerald River. Only a single, magical tear from the Naga can heal the tree. But the Naga will only grant it to one with a pure heart and a sharp mind. The journey begins where the river is busiest... the floating market. Find the one they call Auntie Kai. She knows the river's secrets."_

*(OLLIE's eyes widen. He rolls up the journal and puts it in his small satchel.)*

---
### **CHAPTER 2: THE FLOATING MARKET OF WHISPERS**

**SCENE 1**

*SETTING: A bright, noisy, and colorful floating market. Many boats are selling fruits, food, and flowers. The sound of talking and laughing is everywhere.*

*(OLLIE, looking small and a little lost, paddles a small boat through the chaos.)*

**OLLIE:**
Excuse me... have you seen someone named Auntie Kai?

*(He asks a few vendors, but they just try to sell him things. Finally, he sees an older woman with a kind, clever face and twinkling eyes, skillfully paddling a boat full of mangoes.)*

**AUNTIE KAI:**
Looking for someone, little owl?

**OLLIE:**
Are you Auntie Kai? My great-grandfather's journal said you could help me.

**AUNTIE KAI:**
*(She laughs, a warm, crackling sound.)*
That old book! So, the tree is weak again. The river's secrets are not given so easily. The market is full of distractions. Can you focus in all this chaos? Let's play a little game. Watch the boats. If you can follow my tricks, I will help you.

*(This begins the levels with the "Shell Game" / Dynamic Obstacles twist.)*

---
**SCENE 2**

*SETTING: A quieter part of the market. AUNTIE KAI is impressed.*

**AUNTIE KAI:**
Ha! Your eyes are sharp, little one. Just like your great-grandfather. You have a strong mind. You will need it. Here, take this boat. And this map... it is woven from the river's own plants. It will show you the way.

*(She hands him a small, sturdy boat and a green map.)*

**AUNTIE KAI:**
Follow the river to the Emerald Fields. But be careful. The land there is old and magical. It will only help those who show it respect.

---
### **CHAPTER 3: THE EMERALD FIELDS**

**SCENE 1**

*SETTING: Wide, green, terraced rice paddies under a bright blue sky. It is very quiet and peaceful.*

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
> Ollie followed the map to the Emerald Fields. The air was calm, but he could feel a different kind of magic here... the magic of patience.

*(As OLLIE starts a level, a faint glow appears on some cards.)*

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
> The Rice Spirits who guard this land are shy. They teach that nothing should be wasted. Not a grain of rice, not a single move. Be efficient, and they will bless you with their light.

*(This introduces the "Move Limits" and "Power-Up Pairs" twists.)*

---
### **CHAPTER 4: THE SUNKEN TEMPLE OF AYUTTHAYA**

**SCENE 1**

*SETTING: The vine-covered ruins of an ancient temple. Stone statues of giant guardians (Yaksha) stand silent. Some paths are blocked by gates with magical locks.*

> **ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
> The path led to an ancient, sleeping temple. To pass, Ollie needed to honor the guardians by restoring the temple's broken memories.

*(OLLIE approaches a locked gate. An inscription on it glows.)*

> **INSCRIPTION TEXT:**
> Our memories are scattered. The patterns are broken. A true guardian can see the connections and unlock the path. Restore the memories around me to open the way.

*(This introduces the "Locked & Chained Cards" twist.)*

---
### **CHAPTER 5: THE HERMIT OF DOI SUTHEP**

**SCENE 1**

*SETTING: A simple hut high on a misty mountain. An old, wise hermit (a Lersi) sits meditating.*

**LERSI:**
*(His eyes are closed, but he speaks in a calm, quiet voice.)*
You have traveled far, little owl. Your heart is pure. But the Great Naga sees more than just your heart.

**OLLIE:**
What else is there?

**LERSI:**
The Naga sees the Three Faces of Truth. The simple truth of what is... the hidden truth of what was... and the deeper truth of what connects them all. A simple pair is not enough. You must learn to see the world in threes. Let your mind be still, and I will teach you.

*(This introduces the "3-Card Matches" twist.)*

---
### **CHAPTER 6: THE NAGA'S TEAR**

**SCENE 1**

*SETTING: A magical, glowing underwater realm. The water is clear, and the palace is made of river gems.*

*(OLLIE swims into a large chamber. The GREAT NAGA is there, a huge and beautiful serpent with emerald scales. Its voice is not spoken, but felt in OLLIE's mind.)*

**GREAT NAGA:**
<font size=5><b>...Little Guardian...</b></font>
<font size=4>Many seek my power. Few seek my wisdom. You have learned from the river, the land, and the sky. You have shown respect. Now, you face the final test. Show me the strength of your memory. Show me you are worthy of my tear.</font>

*(This begins the final "Gauntlet" levels, combining all the twists.)*

---
**SCENE 2**

*SETTING: The Naga's chamber, after the final test.*

**GREAT NAGA:**
<font size=4>You have done well. Your mind is sharp, but your heart is pure. You do not seek power, but healing. This is the mark of a true guardian.</font>

*(A single, shimmering tear, glowing with a soft light, floats down from the Naga's eye. OLLIE catches it gently in a lotus leaf.)*

**OLLIE:**
Thank you, Great Naga.

---
### **EPILOGUE: THE MEMORIES RETURN**

**SCENE 1**

*SETTING: Baan Sook Jai Village. OLLIE has returned.*

*(OLLIE rushes to the pale Banyan tree. He places the lotus leaf with the Naga's Tear at its great root. A wave of soft, green and gold light spreads up the trunk, through the branches, and into every leaf. The tree is vibrant and healthy again.)*

*(GRANDMOTHER walks up to OLLIE and begins to softly sing.)*

**GRANDMOTHER:**
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star... how I wonder what you are..." Oh, Ollie! I remember! I remember the song!

*(All around the village, people are laughing, hugging, and sharing stories. The memories have returned. OLLIE looks up at the beautiful, strong Tree of Memories, now a true guardian, just like his ancestors.)*
